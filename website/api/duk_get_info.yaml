name: duk_get_info

proto: |
  void duk_get_info(duk_context *ctx, duk_idx_t idx);

stack: |
  [ ... val! ... ] -> [ ... val! ... info! ]

summary: |
  <p>Inspect value at <code>idx</code> and push an object containing Duktape
  specific information about the object.  Equivalent to <code>Duktape.info()</code>
  in Ecmascript code.  The keys in the result object are not under versioning
  guarantees and may change even in minor releases (but not in patch releases).
  If the value stack index is invalid, still returns an info object describing
  a "none" value.</p>

  <p>The purpose of this primitive is to allow applications to gain access to
  internal fields related to an argument value.  Using an object result is
  flexible and versioning friendly, and avoids the need for a lot of individual
  bindings to inspect individual internal fields related to a value.</p>

  <p>The result object is not under versioning guarantees as a practical
  compromise: internals change quite frequently, so the choices are either to
  make no versioning guarantees or avoid exposing internals that may provide
  blockers to versioning.  As such, calling code should never rely on having
  a certain set of fields available, and it may be necessary to check
  <code>DUK_VERSION</code> when interpreting the result fields.</p>

example: |
  duk_get_info(ctx, -3);
  duk_get_prop_string(ctx, -1, "refc");
  printf("refcount: %ld\n", (long) duk_to_int(ctx, -1));
  duk_pop(ctx);
